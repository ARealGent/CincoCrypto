# CincoCrypto
Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting Tool

The Python program is meant to assist all audiences when making 1-day ahead cryptocurrency price predictions. The program has been developed for the developer's Master Thesis and is published on GitHub to contribute to the open-source work efforts in regards to cryptocurrency investments. Results obtained from this model should be considered tentative at best and not an absolute source of truth for making cryptocurrency price predictions.

The program works by uploading five cryptocurrency datasets of any length from CryptoCompare. It is required for the soucr code file and the datasets to be in the same working directory, otherwise, the program will not be able to locate the directories. The output file and the the resulting graphs are saved on the same directory as the sourc code.
